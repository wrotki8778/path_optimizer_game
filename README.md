# path_optimizer_game
This repo will contain a draft of online (?) arcade game regarding moving a point in a vector field.
The concept for the game includes the following:
* insert mechanism for moving the subject across the 2D plane with vectors attached to provide the resulting directions
* the goal of the game will be to guide the point via the selected point/curve to be as close as possible (todo: set the objective function precisely)
* make the game "non-pathetic" and make the development better than the last time with SJ hub
* provide the mechanism for saving results to external DB
* it is the sandbox for checking the cloud and new SE ideas in practice
* probably will be developed as time allows (i.e. never)
